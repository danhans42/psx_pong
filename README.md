My first ever PlayStation game Yay! Cant take all the credit though...

Its very simple, probably poorly written but was written quickly as a simple
example of how to throw something together.

It uses one pad for both players. UP/DOWN are player 1, CIRCLE/X are player 2.

Needs a few extra things really difficulty/two pads/hiscore maybe etc.

This was written using the helloworld_and_flappycredits Pad/GPU example by Sicklebrick
as a base, and using the info from the following links :-
